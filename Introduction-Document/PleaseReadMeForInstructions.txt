For some reason unknown to me this .tex document compiles with writelatex.com, 
but fails to compile with the linux command pdflatex. 

Basicaly if you decide to edit it, you may need to copy and paste the text onto writelatex.com 
in order to compile it. I don't know if we'd prefer to collaboratively use writelatex.com 
as well to edit the doc, but I'd quite like if we were using github, as we will nedd to show 
the logs for PSD and this is good practice. :)

Cheers,
