For some reason unknown to me this .tex document compiles with writelatex.com, 
but fails to compile with the linux command pdflatex. 

Basicaly if you decide to edit it, you may need to copy and paste the text onto writelatex.com 
in order to compile it. I don't know if we'd prefer to collaboratively use writelatex.com 
as well to edit the doc, but I'd quite like if we were using github, as we will nedd to show 
the logs for PSD and this is good practice. :)

The above is true for the first template (which I have named V1), but I have made another template with exactly the same contents in the folder named IntroductionDocV2. It is in a folder because it needs the extra files to compile on the command line. This template compiles on the command line, but ik don't think it compiles on writelatex.com unless you upload all the files it requires. Anyway, I'm not sure which I prefer yet, I'm not 100% convinced that either of them look brilliant if I'm honest but they may look better with more padding.
