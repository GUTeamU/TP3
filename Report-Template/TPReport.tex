\label{intro}
\section{Project Synopsis}
The school of Computing Science are looking for an exciting demonstration for their 750kg robot to perform. The aim of this project is to design and implement such a demonstration.
\section{Background}
The robot belongs to a much larger project, named CLoPeMa. CLoPeMa is an EU-FP7 project, meaning it is funded by the EU as a recognised science and technological research project. This project runs across four universities in Europe those being: University of Glasgow, University of Genoa(Italy), Czech Tecnical University and the Centre for Research \& Technology Hellas (Greece). 
The main aims of the CLoPeMa project is to use the cameras attached to the robot's arms in order to manipulate, percieve and fold a variety of textiles. This is a really fascinating and challenging project from a mechanics point of view, but doesn't provide very stimulating demonstrations.
\section{Motivation}
The school of Computing Science own their own 750kg robot as part of another research project and are looking to showcase the robot's dexterity in the form of a demonstration. This demonstration will be shown at various university events including undergraduate open days to appeal to prospective students.
\section{Aims}
The aim of this project is to design and implement a sequence of actions for the robot to perform that showcases the ablility of the robot and is not only exciting to watch, but also intelectually stimulating. 
Our overall goal was to...
The high level description of the demonstration which we came up with was for the robot to:
\begin{itemize}
\item take a photograph of a person in the room from one of it's in-built cameras
\item pick up a pen from a table in front of it
\item run line detection software on the image
\item draw the image on a sheet of paper also on the table
\end{itemize}
The remainder of the report will explain each stage of the demonstration further and the difficulties we faced at each stage. The report will also describe our alternative design choices. //I don't like that phrase
